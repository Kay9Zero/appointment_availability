# Appointment Availability API Service

## Making the Code More Maintainable and Production-Ready

In order to have this code to be more maintainable and production-ready, the following improvements could be made:

1. Better Error Handling, such as in having try/except blocks within the controller functions and return appropriate HTTP error codes
2. Implement a logging system, which can be very helpful debugging issues that may occur in production.
3. Implement automated tests to increase confidence that the app works will work as expected going forward and to preventing regressions when changes are made.
4. Refactor the following places:
   * Have the multiple outbound HTTP calls in `soonest_available_appointment` be done in parallel instead of sequencially for quicker performance
   * Implement caching where outbound HTTP calls are made in both `soonest_available_appointment` and `get_zipcode`.
   * Consider utilizing a database instead of csvfiles for mapping locations to zipcodes within `get_location_ids_by_zipcode`
   * The `get_zipcode` function could be split into two separate functions: one to handle the API request and another to process the response. This would make the code more readable, and each function can be tested independently. 
5. Add Code Linters to ensure the code repo is clean and adheres to standard conventions.

These changes will make it easier for other developers to understand your code, catch potential bugs or issues, and contribute to your project, overall improving the maintainability and readiness of the project.
